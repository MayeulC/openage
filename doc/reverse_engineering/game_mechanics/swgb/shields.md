# Shields mechanics in SWGB

## Intro

Shields are another unique feature of the SWGB franchise. A shielded unit has
double the number of hit points that of an unshielded one, and those extra hit
points regenerate.

## Mechanism

A shielded unit gradually fills a shield bar (originally yellow and placed
under the health bar), that doubles its health points. Aditionally, shielded
units have a yellow glow effect, and the UI lights the left indicator in yellow
when a shielded unit is selected, as visible
[here]([200~https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwAtMv_eiM4&feature=youtu.be&t=1786]).

Shields are depleted first when taking hits, before the regular health bar.
Regenerating shields do not affect the health bar.

### Modifiers

When losing the shield ability (like when exiting a shield generator), the
shield points will gradually deplete. They will gradually replenish when
regaining the ability.

Shielded units always spawn with an empty shield.
