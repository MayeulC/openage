# Stealth mechanics in SWGB

## Intro

A few units have a "stealth" ability. This is shown in the game UI by lighting
up the stealth indicator when the unit is selected.

This feature is unique to the SWGB franchise among games that run on the Genie
Engine. Unfortunately, it is somewhat underutilized in the game.

## Mechanism

A stealthed unit cannot be seen by the enemy.

### Modifiers

A stealthed unit is unconcealed when it either:
* Attacks
* Is inside the line of sight of a detector unit
