# Power (energy) mechanics in SWGB

## Intro

Power is a unique feature of SWGB. It is necessary to produce units
efficiently, and for shield generators. It thus makes power generators a
strategic target.

Powered buildings have green lights on them, instead of flashing red lights. A
green indicator also lights up in the UI when a powered unit is selected.

## Mechanism

Power **only** affects unit creation and research times.

It doesn't affect things like food production for animal nurseries, or other
resource collection.


Powered buildings research and produce units 300% faster. Shield generator
buildings need to be powered.

SWGBCC contains mobile power generators.
